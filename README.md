# Password Strength Checker

The Password Strength Checker is a Python-based tool designed to evaluate the security level of a password. It analyzes the password's strength based on parameters such as length, the inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The primary goal of this project is to promote better password practices by providing users with feedback on their password's strength.

# Key Features:
Password Strength Evaluation:
Categorizes passwords as Weak, Moderate, or Strong based on defined criteria.

Dynamic Feedback:
Suggests improvements for weak passwords (e.g., "Add special characters" or "Increase length").

User-Friendly:
Easy-to-use script with a clean and simple interface.

Beginner-Friendly Code:
Written with simplicity in mind, making it an excellent example for Python learners.

# Use Cases:
Educates users about password security.
Helps users create stronger passwords to secure their accounts.
Can be integrated into larger projects for automated password validation.

# How to Use:
Install Python on your system.
# Run the script using the following command:
# python password_strength_checker.py
Enter a password when prompted, and the tool will provide feedback on its strength.

# Technology Used:
Programming Language: Python
Modules Used: (if any specific modules like re for regex or string, mention them)

# Future Scope:
Adding graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.
Implementing real-time password strength feedback during typing.
Expanding criteria for strength evaluation (e.g., avoiding common passwords).
