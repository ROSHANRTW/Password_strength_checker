# A simple password strength checker built using Python. This is my first program in cybersecurity!
Password Strength Checker – Overview
The Password Strength Checker is a Python-based tool that evaluates password security by analyzing its length, use of uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It categorizes passwords as Weak, Moderate, or Strong, providing suggestions to improve weak ones, such as adding special characters or increasing length.

This user-friendly and beginner-focused script is perfect for learning basic Python concepts while promoting secure password practices. It’s a practical tool for creating stronger passwords and can be integrated into larger systems for automated validation.

Future Scope:
Enhancements like a graphical user interface (GUI), real-time feedback during typing, and expanded evaluation criteria can further improve its usability.
